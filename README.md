# **SafeSignal**

## **Proposed Solution:**

**Description:**
SafeSignal is a comprehensive solution that integrates crowdsourced disaster reporting with map-based hotspot detection. The platform enables users to report real-time disaster data such as flood levels, road blockages, and other relevant incidents. Additionally, users can view disaster hotspots, such as regions experiencing high rainfall or multiple disaster events.

**Problem Addressed:**
SafeSignal accelerates disaster response by leveraging real-time data from affected individuals, allowing authorities to identify critical areas (hotspots) where resources need to be prioritized.

**Innovation:**
- **Real-Time Crowdsourced Data**: Allows users to report incidents in real-time, providing essential updates from affected areas.
- **Hotspot Detection**: Highlights regions with significant activity or disasters, helping in better resource allocation.
- **Integrated Visual Data**: Offers an intuitive and visual representation of disaster hotspots and reports.
