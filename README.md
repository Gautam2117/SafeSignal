# **SafeSignal**

# Proposed Solution:

**Description:**
A comprehensive solution that combines crowdsourced disaster reporting with map based hotspot detection. Users can report disaster data such as flood levels, road blockages, and view disaster hotspots, like areas experiencing high rainfall or multiple events.

**Problem Addressed:**

Speeds up disaster response by providing data from affected individuals, while also identifying critical areas (hotspots) where resources need to be prioritized.

**Innovation:**
Real-Time Crowdsourced Data
Hotspot Detection
Integrated Visual Data
